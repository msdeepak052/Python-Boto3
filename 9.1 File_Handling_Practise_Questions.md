Here are **15 Python file handling questions** ranging from beginner to advanced, along with their solutions at the end.  

---

## **Beginner Level**  

### **1. Create and Write to a File**  
Write a program that creates a file named `hello.txt` and writes the text `"Hello, World!"` into it.  

### **2. Read and Display File Content**  
Write a program that reads the contents of `hello.txt` and prints them to the console.  

### **3. Append Text to a File**  
Write a program that appends the line `"Welcome to Python!"` to the existing `hello.txt` file.  

### **4. Count Lines in a File**  
Write a program that counts the number of lines in a given file (`data.txt`).  

### **5. Copy File Content**  
Write a program that copies the content of `source.txt` to `destination.txt`.  

---

## **Intermediate Level**  

### **6. Count Words in a File**  
Write a program that counts the total number of words in a given file (`story.txt`).  

### **7. Find and Replace in a File**  
Write a program that replaces all occurrences of the word `"Python"` with `"Java"` in a file (`code.txt`).  

### **8. Read CSV File and Calculate Average**  
Given a CSV file (`grades.csv`) with student names and their scores, write a program that calculates the average score.  

### **9. Merge Two Files**  
Write a program that merges the contents of `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` into a new file `merged.txt`.  

### **10. Extract Specific Lines**  
Write a program that extracts and prints lines containing a keyword (e.g., `"error"`) from a log file (`server.log`).  

---

## **Advanced Level**  

### **11. File Encryption & Decryption**  
Write a program that encrypts a file (`secret.txt`) using a simple Caesar cipher (shift by 3) and saves it as `encrypted.txt`. Then, write a decryption program.  

### **12. Read and Parse JSON File**  
Given a JSON file (`data.json`), write a program that extracts specific fields (e.g., `"name"` and `"age"`) and prints them.  

### **13. Log File Analyzer**  
Write a program that reads a log file (`app.log`), counts occurrences of different log levels (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`), and generates a summary report.  

### **14. Binary File Handling (Images)**  
Write a program that copies a binary file (`image.jpg`) to `image_copy.jpg` without corruption.  

### **15. Directory Traversal & File Search**  
Write a program that searches for all `.txt` files in a directory and its subdirectories, then lists their names and sizes.

## **Solutions**  

### **1. Create and Write to a File**  
```python
with open("hello.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

### **2. Read and Display File Content**  
```python
with open("hello.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())
```

### **3. Append Text to a File**  
```python
with open("hello.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nWelcome to Python!")
```

### **4. Count Lines in a File**  
```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(f"Total lines: {len(lines)}")
```

### **5. Copy File Content**  
```python
with open("source.txt", "r") as src, open("destination.txt", "w") as dest:
    dest.write(src.read())
```

### **6. Count Words in a File**  
```python
with open("story.txt", "r") as file:
    words = file.read().split()
    print(f"Total words: {len(words)}")
```

### **7. Find and Replace in a File**  
```python
with open("code.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
content = content.replace("Python", "Java")
with open("code.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(content)
```

### **8. Read CSV and Calculate Average**  
```python
import csv
with open("grades.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(reader)  # Skip header
    scores = [float(row[1]) for row in reader]
    print(f"Average: {sum(scores)/len(scores)}")
```

### **9. Merge Two Files**  
```python
with open("file1.txt", "r") as f1, open("file2.txt", "r") as f2, open("merged.txt", "w") as out:
    out.write(f1.read() + f2.read())
```

### **10. Extract Specific Lines**  
```python
with open("server.log", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        if "error" in line.lower():
            print(line.strip())
```

### **11. File Encryption & Decryption**  
```python
# Encryption
def encrypt_file(input_file, output_file, shift=3):
    with open(input_file, "r") as f_in, open(output_file, "w") as f_out:
        for char in f_in.read():
            if char.isalpha():
                shifted = chr((ord(char.lower()) - 97 + shift) % 26 + 97)
                f_out.write(shifted)
            else:
                f_out.write(char)

# Decryption (shift by -3)
encrypt_file("secret.txt", "encrypted.txt", shift=3)
encrypt_file("encrypted.txt", "decrypted.txt", shift=-3)
```

### **12. Read and Parse JSON File**  
```python
import json
with open("data.json", "r") as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    for person in data:
        print(f"Name: {person['name']}, Age: {person['age']}")
```

### **13. Log File Analyzer**  
```python
from collections import defaultdict
counts = defaultdict(int)
with open("app.log", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        if "INFO" in line:
            counts["INFO"] += 1
        elif "WARNING" in line:
            counts["WARNING"] += 1
        elif "ERROR" in line:
            counts["ERROR"] += 1
print("Log Summary:", dict(counts))
```

### **14. Binary File Handling (Images)**  
```python
with open("image.jpg", "rb") as src, open("image_copy.jpg", "wb") as dest:
    dest.write(src.read())
```

### **15. Directory Traversal & File Search**  
```python
import os
for root, dirs, files in os.walk("."):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith(".txt"):
            path = os.path.join(root, file)
            size = os.path.getsize(path)
            print(f"File: {path}, Size: {size} bytes")
```
