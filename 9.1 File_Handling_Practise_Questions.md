Here are **15 Python file handling questions** ranging from beginner to advanced, along with their solutions at the end.  

---

## **Beginner Level**  

### **1. Create and Write to a File**  
Write a program that creates a file named `hello.txt` and writes the text `"Hello, World!"` into it.

### **2. Read and Display File Content**  
Write a program that reads the contents of `hello.txt` and prints them to the console.  

```python
with open('text.log', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
```
### **3. Append Text to a File**  
Write a program that appends the line `"Welcome to Python!"` to the existing `hello.txt` file.

```python

text1 = "New Lines added in the existing files\n"
with open('text.log', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

if text1 not in lines:
    print("Text added to the file if not already present.\n")
    with open('text.log', 'a') as f:
        f.write(text1)


with open('text.log', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line)
```

### **4. Count Lines in a File**  
Write a program that counts the number of lines in a given file (`data.txt`). 

```python
with open('text.log', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    print(len(lines))
```

### **5. Copy File Content**  
Write a program that copies the content of `source.txt` to `destination.txt`.  
```python
with open("text.log", "r") as src, open("destination.log", "w") as dest:
    dest.write(src.read())
    print("File copied successfully.")
```

- Bonus
```python
# Read all lines from the file
with open("text.log", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

# Replace the line
with open("text.log", "w") as file:
    for line in lines:
        if line.strip().startswith("timeout"):
            file.write("timeout = 60\n")
        else:
            file.write(line)


```

## **Intermediate Level**  

### **6. Count Words in a File**  
Write a program that counts the total number of words in a given file (`text.log`).  

```python
import string

with open("text.log", "r") as src:
    content = src.read()
    words = content.split()

    # Remove punctuation from each word before checking
    cleaned_words = [word.strip(string.punctuation) for word in words]

    print(cleaned_words)

    alnum_count = sum(1 for word in cleaned_words if word.isalnum())
    print(f"Number of alphanumeric words: {alnum_count}")
```

```
C:\Deepak\Devops\Python\Python\venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Deepak\Devops\Python\Python\venv\Scripts\test.py 
['Hello', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'test', 'New', 'Lines', 'added', 'in', 'the', 'existing', 'files']
Number of alphanumeric words: 12
```


### **7. Find and Replace in a File**  
Write a program that replaces all occurrences of the word `"Python"` with `"Java"` in a file (`text.log`). 

```python
with open("text.log", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()
data = data.replace("Python","Java")
with open('text.log','w') as w:
    w.write(data)
```

### **8. Read CSV File and Calculate Average**  
Given a CSV file (`grades.csv`) with student names and their scores, write a program that calculates the average score.

```python

with open("grades.csv", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
sum = 0
for line in lines[1:]:
    parts = line.strip().split(",")
    print("Name:", parts[0], "Grade:", int(parts[1]))
    sum = sum + int(parts[1])
print("Sum of grades:", sum)
print(f"Average grade: {int(sum/len(lines[1:]))}")

```

```python

C:\Deepak\Devops\Python\Python\venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Deepak\Devops\Python\Python\venv\Scripts\test.py 
Name: Alice Grade: 80
Name: Bob Grade: 90
Name: Charlie Grade: 70
Sum of grades: 240
Average grade: 80


```

### **9. Merge Two Files**  
Write a program that merges the contents of `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` into a new file `merged.txt`.  

```python
with open("file1.txt", "r") as f1, open("file2.txt", "r") as f2, open("merged.txt", "w") as out:
    out.write(f1.read() + f2.read())
```

### **10. Extract Specific Lines**  
Write a program that extracts and prints lines containing a keyword (e.g., `"error"`) from a log file (`server.log`).  

```python

with open("text.log", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
error_text = "ERROR".lower()
for line in lines:
    if error_text in line.lower():
        print(line.strip())
```

## **Advanced Level**  

### **11. File Encryption & Decryption**  
Write a program that encrypts a file (`secret.txt`) using a simple Caesar cipher (shift by 3) and saves it as `encrypted.txt`. Then, write a decryption program.  

Refer from below

### **12. Read and Parse JSON File**  
Given a JSON file (`data.json`), write a program that extracts specific fields (e.g., `"name"` and `"age"`) and prints them.  

### **13. Log File Analyzer**  
Write a program that reads a log file (`app.log`), counts occurrences of different log levels (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`), and generates a summary report.

```python
count_error = 0
count_warning = 0
count_info = 0
with open('text.log', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
for line in lines:
    if "error" in line.lower():
        count_error+=1
    elif "warning" in line.lower():
        count_warning+=1
    elif "info" in line.lower():
        count_info+=1
    else:
        continue
print(f"Errors: {count_error}, Warnings: {count_warning}, Infos: {count_info}")

```

```python
